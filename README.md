# LearningPagingLibrary
This repo shows some example of how to use the Paging Library.

The recommended way of using the paging library is with the `PagedListAdapter`, but I find it a little too magical for me to understand. So in this post, I want to explore using `PagedList` directly before using it with `PagedListAdapter`.

I made have 2 different activities which use the `PagedList` and `RxPagedList` directly to load more data.
